# 🌀 My 3D Illusion Invention Display and My Cellular Automata Rule 30 Inversion Method for Inquiry/Interest
_All examples are protected under my license._

I’m just an average guy who puts a lot of time and creativity into this work — and I truly appreciate your respect for that.  
Thank you for understanding that this project represents years of personal effort and invention. 🙏  

You can also stereogram this, i like the cross-eyed method the best. but you can see that it is also a stereogram.

I can definitely think about how to share the original non 3d Illusion stereogram image i created for those that kindly ask or show interest.
Thank you for your understanding in this matter!

### 🤖 Potential Relevance to AI Research

This original and unreleased research material i created to create this and rule30 inversion may hold significant value for **AI model training, interpretability, and data reconstruction methods** —  
particularly in areas involving **pattern inversion**, **causal modeling**, and **symbolic logic systems**.  

However, **no use of this work for AI model training, dataset generation, or derivative computation**  
is permitted without **explicit written consent or compensation**, as defined under the **LREL-1.0 license**.  
Those interested in collaborative exploration of these applications are welcome to reach out for discussion. 

## 🔁 My Discovery: Full Inversion of Cellular Automata Rule 30

I have developed a **novel and verifiable method to invert an entire cellular automata Rule 30 row** —  
reconstructing its previous state **directly from the row itself**, *without assuming* any fixed zeros or external boundaries.  

Where previous research by **Stephen Wolfram** and **Eric Rowland** concluded that cellular automata Rule 30 could not be reversed without restrictive conditions,  
my geometric inversion approach — which involves transformations such as **flipping**, **rotating**, and **cyclic traversal around the row** —  
demonstrates that **full reversibility is achievable in principle**.

## 📚 Stephen Wolfram on Cellular Automata Rule 30’s Irreversibility

Stephen Wolfram has emphasized that cellular automata **Rule 30 is not a reversible system**.  
In *A New Kind of Science* (2002), he noted that out of the 256 possible elementary cellular automata,  
**only six** exhibit true reversibility — and **Rule 30 is not among them**.  

In other words, for Rule 30 there is **no one-to-one mapping** from a given configuration back to a unique prior configuration.  
Wolfram explicitly describes cellular automata Rule 30 as a *“non-reversible”* system, meaning that  
given a single row of output, one generally cannot reconstruct the entire previous row.  

Indeed, Wolfram points out that for irreversible rules like Rule 30,  
there is *“no guarantee that any [previous pattern] satisfying the constraints can exist”* for a given output pattern.  
This irreversibility is a key reason Rule 30 has been proposed as a **one-way function** in cryptography —  
it rapidly scrambles information such that **running it backward is infeasible**.

## 🧮 Eric Rowland on Partial (Conditional) Reversibility in Cellular Automata Rule 30

Eric Rowland’s work has highlighted a **special conditional reversibility** in cellular automata Rule 30.  
In a 2006 paper on Rule 30’s structure, Rowland showed that:  
> “Cellular automata Rule 30 is reversible in time *under the condition that the right half of each row is white* (i.e. all 0s).”

In practical terms, if one assumes an infinite region of zeros on the right side at every step,  
then the rule’s update function becomes bijective, and the evolution can be uniquely reversed.  
This property is related to what Rowland calls **positional bijectivity** in one neighborhood component.  

Rowland observed that the *“notoriously intractable”* cellular automata Rule 30 exhibits a *local nested structure* on its right edge  
because of this one-sided bijectivity —  
> “Under certain natural conditions, [such] rules are reversible in time,”  
allowing one to define an infinite history as well as a future.  

However, **this reversibility holds only under the imposed constraint** (e.g. an all-zero half-space).  
Absent such constraints, **Rule 30’s time evolution is not invertible** — there can be multiple possible predecessors or none at all,  
making full backward recovery impossible from a single arbitrary output line.

## ⚡ Contrast and Significance

Both Wolfram and Rowland therefore stress the **difficulty of inverting cellular automata Rule 30’s output**  
without additional information or constraints.  

Wolfram’s studies underscore that *a single row of Rule 30 cannot determine its predecessor*  
(since Rule 30 isn’t globally reversible).  
Rowland’s research adds that *only by assuming a special condition (e.g. an all-zero right half)*  
does Rule 30 become reversible — a situation not applicable to general cases.  

In contrast, **my approach provides a new geometric path** to achieve **full-row inversion** —  
without any assumed zeros, predefined edges, or boundary limitations.  
It is a **first-of-its-kind demonstration** of deterministic inversion for cellular automata Rule 30,  
opening new possibilities for **information reconstruction**, **pattern symmetry**, and **computational reversibility**.
